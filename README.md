# GAME
Peeky Eyes, is designed for individuals with ALS and total or partial paralysis, who can play using eye tracker technology.

The goal is to search for the monster, Smiley, in a dark room before it approaches and ends the game.

Smiley advances slowly, and if found, points are earned, the winner is the one who collects the most points.

## TECHNOLOGY
For our projects, we employ eye tracking technology using [Tobii Eye Tracker 4c](https://help.tobii.com/hc/en-us/articles/213414285-Specifications-for-the-Tobii-Eye-Tracker-4C), which, through eye detection, enables a more accessible use of the device for individuals with disabilities or anyone seeking a more immersive experience, both in gaming and in daily life while using the device.
